# Hollywood_and_Bollywood_network_analysis
The film industry is inherently collaborative — actors frequently co-star in multiple movies,
forming intricate networks of professional relationships.
Understanding how these collaboration networks evolve over time can reveal structural patterns
that shape the careers of actors and the dynamics of film industries.
This project aims to analyze and compare the temporal evolution of actor–actor collaboration
networks in two major film industries: Hollywood and Bollywood.
By examining how these networks change across decades, we can gain insights into whether
Bollywood’s tightly-knit collaboration culture contrasts with Hollywood’s more hub-based, star-driven model.
